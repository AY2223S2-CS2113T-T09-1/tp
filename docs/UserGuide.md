### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any budgeting application is to add transactions. The "add" function of rainyDay allows you
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions
to rainyDay.

#### Simple Usage

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT]`

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `in` signifying an inflow type of transaction, or
    * `out` signifying an outflow type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of words
* `AMOUNT` signifies the cost of transaction, needs to be a number more than or equal to 0

Example of usage:

You received a gift of $500 from your mother. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -in gift from mom $500` - Signifies an inflow with the description "gift from mom" of value "$500"

You paid for your school fees of $1000.50. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -out school fees $1000.50` - Signifies an outflow with the description "school fees" of value "$1000.50"

#### Advanced Usage

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT] {-c CATEGORY} {-date DD/MM/YYYY}`

* `DIRECTION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT` is as mentioned under [Simple Usage](#simple-usage)
* `CATEGORY` can contain any characters and space
* `DD/MM/YYYY` represents a valid date, where
    * `DD` is a two-digit number representing the day
    * `MM` is a two-digit number representing the month
    * `YYYY` is a four-digit number representing the year

Example of usage:

You received your monthly income of $2000 on 05/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to
rainyDay:

* `add -in income $2000 -c pay -date 05/03/2023` - Signifies an inflow with the description "income" of value "$2000",
  under the category of "pay" with the date "05/03/2023"

You had lunch at a hawker centre for $6.80 on 10/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided
to rainyDay:

* `add -out lunch at hawker centre $6.80 -c food and drinks -date 10/03/2023` - Signifies an outflow with the
  description
  "lunch at hawker center" of value "$6.80", under the category of "food and drinks" and with the date "10/03/2023".

> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** The flags `-c` and `-date` can also be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

### Viewing the transactions

An important aspect to track your finances is to view all the transactions that you have already done before. The "view"
command of rainyDay can list all the transaction added, and the resultant amount of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: `view {TIMESPAN} {-sort}`

* `TIMESPAN` is used to denote how much history to show.
    * `1d - 31d` is used to view 1 to 31 days of history
    * `1w - 4w`  is used to view 1 to 4 weeks of history
    * `1m - 12m` is used to view 1 to 12 months of history
    * `1y - 10y` is used to view 1 to 10 years of history
* `-sort` can be included to sort entries in ascending order, with inflows displayed before outflows.

> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** To view all entries you can use -all in place of a specific time in TIMESPAN

![view.png](view.png)

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transaction data,
rainyDay's "delete" function supports removing any previous transaction from your overview.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained from [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of usage:

After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you: <br>
![delete.png](delete.png)
To delete the transaction with the description "lunch at hawker centre", provide the command:

* `delete 2`

The transaction with the description "lunch at hawker centre" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view the transactions will be as such: <br>
![delete1.png](delete1.png)

### Filter statements

To ease your time searching through all the entries in the financial report, the "filter" function of rainyDay
will help you extract certain transactions based on a specific criteria

Format : `filter FLAG FIELD`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to filter by description
    * `-c` to filter by category
    * `-date` to filter by date
    * `-in` to filter by inflows
    * `-out` to filter by outflows
* date `FIELD` must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY

Example of usage:

After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you:
![viewForFilter.png](viewForFilter.png)

Suppose you want to find out transactions related to chicken, you can use this command:

- `filter -d chicken`
  ![filterChicken.png](filterChicken.png)

Suppose you want to check your outflows only, you can use this command:

- `filter -out`
  ![filterOutflow.png](filterOutflow.png)

> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** Multiple flags may be used at once but must be in this order:
>
> `-d` -> `-c` -> `-date` -> `-in` or `out`
>
> Suppose you want to find out what food you ate on a particular day, you can use this command:
>
> `filter -c Food and Drinks -date 26/03/2023`
>
> ![FilterMultipleFlags.png](FilterMultipleFlags.png)

### Editing a transaction

Should you need to update details in a previous transaction, rainyDay's "edit" function supports changing the details of
a past transaction

Format : `edit INDEX ADDCOMMAND` or `edit INDEX FLAG NEWFIELD` or `edit INDEX FLAG`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `date` to edit the date
    * `-in` to change direction to inflow
    * `-out` to change direction to outflow

* No `NEWFIELD` required for changing direction

Example of usage:

After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you:
![viewForFilter.png](viewForFilter.png)

For example, you realised you made a mistake in the category of entry 1 and want to replace the category of entry 1 with
'Food and Drinks' instead of 'Food', you can use this command:
`edit 1 -c Food and Drinks`
![EditCategory.png](EditCategory.png)

However, if you want to edit multiple fields of an entry, and instead of deleting and adding a new entry, you can use
this command:
`edit 2 add -out Beef noodles $15 -c Food -date 22/03/2023`
![EditMultipleEntries.png](EditMultipleEntries.png)

### Setting a Monthly Budget

In the process of keeping track of your expenses, you might feel inclined to stick to a budget. RainyDay can help
to give you reminders, and encourage you to stick to your budget!
With a set monthly budget, RainyDay will remind you how much you have spent for the month with
every new expense in the same month.

Format : `setbudget GOAL`

For example, if you would like to set a monthly budget goal of $1000, use the command below:
`setbudget 1000`

![setbudgetgoal.png](setbudgetgoal.png)

An additional message will accompany new expenses on how much you have spent for the month!

![messgewithsetbudget.png](messgewithsetbudget.png)

If at any point of time you would like to remove this feature, simply set the goal to $0
`setbudget 0`

![unsetbudgetgoal.png](unsetbudgetgoal.png)

### Adding a shortcut

If you happen to have certain commands that you find yourself frequently using, rainyDay's shortcuts can make it much easier 
to execute those commands!

Format: `shortcut SHORTCUTNAME -maps ACTUALCOMMAND`

* `SHORTCUTNAME` can be any single word of your choice to save a reference to the actual command
* `ACTUALCOMMAND` is the actual command which you want your shortcut to perform

Example of usage:

You often eat the same noodle dish from your favourite coffee shop. To save yourself the trouble of typing the same
command in full everytime, you could configure the shortcut as follows.

`shortcut FavouriteLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food`

### Using a shortcut

After you have configuring your shortcuts, you would like to use the shortcut to save yourself the trouble of typing the full command.
This can be done by providing an input according to the following format:

Format: `SHORTCUTNAME`

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section. Now
all you have to do is input the name of the shortcut as follows.

`FavouriteLunch`

Using the shortcut will allow you to add the same entry for noodles with a shorter command!

![shortcutusage.png](shortcutusage.png)

### Viewing a shortcut

After configuring all your shortcuts, the `view_shortcut` command can be used to keep track of all your shortcuts
that you have configured

Example of Usage:

`view_shortcut`

The output will look something like this:

![viewshortcut.png](viewshortcut.png)

### Deleting a shortcut

At some point, you may discover that the shortcut you configured is no longer useful, or you may have misconfigured a 
previously added shortcut. In such a situation, the delete_shortcut command provided by rainyDay can prove to be quite handy.

Format: `delete_shortcut SHORTCUTCOMMAND`

* `SHORTCUTCOMMAND` The shortcut command that you want deleted

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut section](#adding-a-shortcut).
Unfortunately, your favourite coffee shop has closed down, and you are no longer able to enjoy your favourite noodle
dish. Now the shortcut you previously configured is no longer useful. All you have to do is delete the shortcut as
follows:

`delete_shortcut myshortcut`

### Ignoring an entry

Due to potential certain one-time payments or receivables that you encounter, rainyDay's ignore function can help you 
keep a more accurate track of your finances by allowing you to ignore certain transactions from the overall calculation of your inflow and outflow.
Conversely, the unignore function is to include a transaction that was previously ignored.

Format: `ignore [index]` or `unignore [index]`

* `index` The index of the entry you want to ignore, obtained by using the `view` command

Example of Usage:

You have received a one-time payment from government GST refunds. You would like to keep track of it however do not want to
include it in your budget calculations.  After executing the add command, input view to find its index.
![ignore_view.png](ignore_view.png)

You can then execute the following command to ignore the entry:

`ignore 6`

![ignore.png](ignore.png)

your configured shortcuts.

#### Where is my saved file located?
