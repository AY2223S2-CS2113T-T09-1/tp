# rainyDay User Guide

Welcome to rainyDay's user guide! Thank you so much for choosing rainyDay. We sincerely hope that rainyDay can
successfully take you one step closer to reaching your financial goals!
Should you have any feedback or enquiries, please do not hesitate to drop us at

## Introduction

### Motivation of creating rainyDay

In addition to rising costs of living, young adults like yourself just entering the workforce will be exposed to new 
sources of expenses and income. Thus, rainyDay was created to aid you in keeping track and managing your finances well. 
rainyDay accomplishes this by providing an easy-to-use and convenient platform to track your [inflows and outflows](#glossary), 
to help you achieve your financial goals. 

Despite the availability of other financial trackers, only a handful of them have integrated a 
[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary) into their systems. However, the utilisation of a CLI can significantly
improve the speed and accuracy of user-provided information. Do not fret if you have not used a CLI before as we 
will guide you through the [process](#understanding-cli).

With this user guide, you will be guided through every step of the way from installation to the usage of advanced features 
so that you can be an expert at rainyDay.

### What rainyDay can do for you

rainyDay supports a variety of features for you to view your [transactions](#glossary). A basic overview is provided as 
follows: 

**Transaction related** - adding, deleting and editing transaction entries <br>
**Viewing related** - View, filter or sort transactions based on criteria  <br>
**Budget related** - Setting a budget to adhere to

For more in-depth information, please refer to the [Features Overview](#features-overview) section.

### Transactions

Next is the transaction management section of our guide! In this section, we'll cover all the key details to manage your

We'll also show you how to filter and ignore any transactions that are irrelevant to your

* [Adding a transaction](#adding-a-transaction)
* [Viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)
* [Deleting a transaction](#deleting-a-transaction)
* [Editing a transaction](#editing-a-transaction)
* [Filter transactions](#filter-transactions)
* [Ignoring a transaction](#ignoring-a-transaction)

### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any financial tracker is to add transactions. The "add" feature of rainyDay allows you
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions
to rainyDay.

Format: `add [DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT] {CATEGORY} {DATE}`

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `-in` signifying an [inflow](#glossary) type of transaction, or
    * `-out` signifying an [outflow](#glossary) type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of any characters and space
* `AMOUNT` signifies the value of the transaction, where the number needs to be more than 0, with `$` appended
  before the number
* `CATEGORY` is a field representing the category to be tagged with the transaction, where category can contain any
  characters and space, with `-c` appended before the category
* `DATE` is a field representing the date to be tagged with the transaction, where date needs to be in the format
  of `DAY/MONTH/YEAR`, with <br>`-date` appended before the date
    * `DAY` and `MONTH` can either be single or double-digit number
    * `YEAR` needs to be a four-digit number
    * When this field is omitted, the default date will be set to the day when the transaction is added to rainyDay

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Amount provided must be positive and cannot be more than $21,474,836.47!
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è `DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY` cannot contain dash `-`.

> üí° The flags `-c` and `-date` can be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

Example of usage:

You had dinner at Haidilao for $500. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

```
> add -out Haidilao $500
Done! Added: out for Haidilao, -$500.00, in category miscellaneous on 30/03/2023
```

You received an allowance of $20 on 01/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

```
> add -in Allowance $20 -c Allowance -date 01/03/2023
Done! Added: in for Allowance, +$20.00, in category Allowance on 01/03/2023
```

You had beef noodles for $12. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

```
> add -out beef noodles $12 -c Food and Drinks
Done! Added: out for beef noodles, -$12.00, in category Food and Drinks on 30/03/2023
```

You received your pay of $50000 on 26/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

```
> add -in Pay $50000 -date 26/03/2023
Done! Added: in for Pay, +$50000.00, in category miscellaneous on 26/03/2023
```

### Viewing the transactions

After adding your transaction data into rainyDay, you can view them by using the "view" feature of rainyDay.
This lists all the transaction added, and the summary of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: `view {TIMESPAN} {-sort}`

* `TIMESPAN` is used to specifically denote how much history to show from the current day.
    * `1d - 31d` is used to view 1 to 31 days of history
    * `1w - 4w`  is used to view 1 to 4 weeks of history
    * `1m - 12m` is used to view 1 to 12 months of history
    * `1y - 10y` is used to view 1 to 10 years of history
* `-sort` can be included to sort entries in ascending order of their absolute value,
  with inflows displayed before outflows.

> üí° To view all entries you can use -all in place of a specific time in TIMESPAN

```

|Total Inflow: $50020.00                                                                             |
|Total Outflow: $512.00                                                                              |

To do that, you can use the following command:

```
> view
```

You want to know what you spent the most on in the past 3 months. To do that you can use the following command:

```
> view 3m -sort
```

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transactions,
rainyDay's "delete" feature supports removing any previous transaction from your overview.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to identify a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained from [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of usage:
Your current financial report is at the same state as in the previous example given in
[viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions).
To delete the transaction with the description "beef noodles", you can use the command:

`delete 3`

The transaction with the description "beef noodles" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view the transactions will be as such: <br>

```
> delete 3
Done, deleted "beef noodles" from the financial report
> view
+====================================================================================================+
|Here is your financial report!                                                                      |

+====================================================================================================+

### Editing a transaction

Should you need to update details in a previous transaction, rainyDay's "edit" feature supports this.

Format : `edit [INDEX] [FLAG] {NEWFIELD}`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `-date` to edit the date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
    * `-in` to change direction to [inflows](#glossary)
    * `-out` to change direction to [outflows](#glossary)
* No `NEWFIELD` is required for changing direction

Example of usage:

Suppose you realised you forgot to add the "Category" for entry 1, and you would like to place it under 
"Food and Drinks". You can use the following command:

![editCategory.png](images/UserGuide/editCategory.png)

and use the "view" command to verify the edits are accurate.

![editCategoryView.png](images/UserGuide/editCategoryView.png)

Perhaps you realised you made a mistake in the "Amount" for entry 2 and your allowance is $75 instead.
You can use the following command:

![editValue.png](images/UserGuide/editValue.png)


![editValueView.png](images/UserGuide/editValueView.png)


What happens if you realised you made multiple mistakes in entry 3. Don't worry! You can edit multiple fields at the
same time using multiple flags. However, do take note of the flag order as listed below.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Multiple flags may be used at once but must be in this order:
>
> `-in` or `out` -> `-d` -> `-v` -> `-c` -> `-date`

So instead of deleting and adding an entirely new entry, you can use the following command to update the required fields:

![editMultipleEntries.png](images/UserGuide/editMultipleEntries.png)


![editMultipleEntriesView.png](images/UserGuide/editMultipleEntriesView.png)


[Jump back to features overview](#features-overview)

### Filter transactions

To save time searching through all the entries in the financial report, the "filter" feature of rainyDay
helps you extract certain transactions based on specific criteria.

Format : `filter [FLAG] {FIELD}`

* The `FLAG` must be at least one of the following:
    * `-in` to filter by [inflows](#glossary)
    * `-out` to filter by [outflows](#glossary)
    * `-d` to filter by description
    * `-c` to filter by category
    * `-date` to filter by a specific date or timespan
* No `FIELD` is required when `-in` or `-out` flag is used
* date `FIELD` must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY
* For the `-date` flag, if one date `FIELD` is specified then it is for a specific date. If two date `FIELD` is present
    then it filters by a range. An example is provided below.

Example of usage:

Let's say you added a couple more entries. And using `view -all` provides you with this

![filterViewAll.png](images/UserGuide/filterViewAll.png)

> üí° Note the use of `view -all` instead of `view` as `view` only provides entries in the current month. 

Suppose you want to find out transactions labelled "Food and Drinks", you can use the following command:

![filterFood.png](images/UserGuide/filterFood.png)

What happens if you want to filter the transactions based on multiple criteria? We got you covered!
But do take note of the order as listed below:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple flags may be used at once but must be in this order:

### Ignoring a transaction

Due to potential one-time payments or receivables that you encounter, rainyDay's "ignore" feature can help you
keep a more accurate track of your finances by allowing you to ignore certain transactions from the overall calculation
of your inflow and outflow.
Conversely, the "unignore" feature is to include a transaction that was previously ignored.

Format: `ignore [index]` or `unignore [index]`

* `index` The index of the entry you want to ignore, obtained by using the `view` command

Example of Usage:

You have received a one-time payment from government GST refunds. You would like to keep track of it, however you do 
not want to include it in your budget calculations.

### Setting a Monthly Budget

After knowing how to manage your transactions, the next step to reach your financial goals is to set a monthly budget!
rainyDay can help you by giving you reminders and encouraging you to stick to your budget! With a set monthly budget,
rainyDay will remind you how much you have spent for the month with every new expense.

Format : `setbudget GOAL`

For example, if you would like to set a monthly budget goal of $1000, you can use the following command:

```
> setbudget 1000
Monthly Budget Goal set to $1,000.00!
```

An additional message will accompany new expenses on how much you have spent for the month!

```
> add -out noodles $5
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$5.00
You have spent $544.00/$1000.00, Keep it up!
```

If at any point of time you would like to remove this feature, simply set the goal to $0 by using the following command:

```
> setbudget 0
Monthly Budget Goal removed!
```

### Shortcuts

After using rainyDay for a period of time, you realise that there are some commands that you seem to repeat more
often. rainyDay's "shortcut" feature can be utilised to save time! In this section, we'll show you how to create and 
use shortcuts effectively. Whether you need to add a new shortcut, view an existing one, or delete an old one, we'll 
cover them all. So, if you're ready to start working smarter, not harder, let's dive into the world of shortcuts!

* [Adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut)
* [Using a shortcut](#using-a-shortcut)
* [Viewing a shortcut](#viewing-a-shortcut)
* [Deleting a shortcut](#deleting-a-shortcut)

#### Adding a shortcut

If you would like to add some shortcuts, this is how you can create one!

Format: `shortcut [SHORTCUTNAME] -maps [ACTUALCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTNAME` can be any single word of your choice to save a reference to the actual command
* `ACTUALCOMMAND` is the actual command which you want your shortcut to perform

Example of usage:

You often eat the same noodle dish from your favourite coffee shop. To save yourself the trouble of typing the same
command in full, you can create a shortcut by using the following command:

```
> shortcut FavLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food
Shortcut successfully added
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your created shortcut should map to a valid full command for it to work correctly.

#### Using a shortcut

After creating your shortcuts, you may want to use the shortcut to save yourself the trouble of typing the
full command. This can be done by simply inputting the name of your created shortcut.

Format: `[SHORTCUTNAME]`

Example of Usage:

You have created the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section. Now
all you have to do is input the name of your created shortcut.

```
> FavLunch
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$4.00
```

#### Viewing a shortcut

After creating your shortcuts, the `shortcut_view` command can be used to keep track of all your shortcuts.

Example of Usage:

Here's how you can view your shortcuts:

```
shortcut_view
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Here are your shortcuts!                                                                         |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Shortcut                           |Mapped Command                                               |
|a                                  |add -in daily salary $5                                      |
|v                                  |view                                                         |
|FavLunch                           |add -out noodles $4 -c food                                  |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Deleting a shortcut

At some point, you may discover that the shortcut you created is no longer useful, or you may have incorrectly created a
previously added shortcut. In these situations, the `shortcut_delete` command provided by rainyDay can prove to be quite
handy.

Format: `shortcut_delete [SHORTCUTCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTCOMMAND` The shortcut command that you want deleted

Example of Usage:

You have created the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut section](#adding-a-shortcut).
Unfortunately, your favourite coffee shop has closed down, and you are no longer able to enjoy your favourite noodle
dish. Now the shortcut you previously created is no longer useful. All you have to do is delete the shortcut with the
command below:

`shortcut_delete FavLunch`
