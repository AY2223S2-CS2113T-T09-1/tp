![help.png](help.png)

### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any budgeting application is to add transactions. The "add" function of rainyDay allows you 
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions 
to rainyDay.


#### Simple Usage (For Beginner Users)

The "Simple Usage" of adding transactions is highly recommended for new users who are just starting out. Since rainyDay can comprehend simplified 
instructions given by the user, it provides a user-friendly experience for those who are just starting to learn how to use the basic functions.

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT]`

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `in` signifying an inflow type of transaction, or
    * `out` signifying an outflow type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of words
* `AMOUNT` signifies the cost of transaction, needs to be a number more than or equal to 0

Example of usage:

You received a gift of $500 from your mother. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -in gift from mom $500` - Signifies an inflow with the description "gift from mom" of value "$500"

You paid for your school fees of $1000.50. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -out school fees $1000.50` - Signifies an outflow with the description "school fees" of value "$1000.50"

#### Advanced Usage (For Advanced Users)

The "Advanced Usage" of adding transactions is suitable for more advanced users who are already familiar with the basic functions of
rainyDay. We recommend exploring the advanced features and customization options that the app offers. These features allow 
for greater control and flexibility in using rainyDay to fit specific needs and preferences. 

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT] {-c CATEGORY} {-date DD/MM/YYYY}`

* `DIRECTION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT` is as mentioned under [Simple Usage](#simple-usage--for-beginner-users-) 
* `CATEGORY` can contain any characters and space
* `DD/MM/YYYY` represents a valid date, where
    * `DD` is a two-digit number representing the day
    * `MM` is a two-digit number representing the month
    * `YYYY` is a four-digit number representing the year

Example of usage:

You received your monthly income of $2000 on 05/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to
rainyDay:

* `add -in income $2000 -c pay -date 05/03/2023` - Signifies an inflow with the description "income" of value "$2000", 
under the category of "pay" with the date "05/03/2023"

You had lunch at a hawker centre for $6.80 on 10/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to
rainyDay:

* `add -out lunch at hawker centre $6.80 -c food and drinks -date 10/03/2023` - Signifies an outflow with the description 
"lunch at hawker center" of value "$6.80", under the category of "food and drinks" and with the date "10/03/2023".

> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** The flags `-c` and `-date` can also be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

### Viewing the transactions

An important aspect to track your finances is to view all the transactions that you have already done before. The "view"
command of rainyDay will list all the transaction added, the resultant amount of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: `view`

The output will look something similar to below

![view.png](view.png)

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transaction data,
rainyDay's "delete" function supports removing any previous transaction from your overview.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained from [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of usage:
After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you: <br>
![delete.png](delete.png)
To delete the transaction with the description lunch at hawker centre, provide the command:

* `delete 2`

The transaction with the description "lunch at hawker centre" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view the transactions will be as such: <br>

![delete1.png](delete1.png)

### Filter statements

To ease your time searching through all the entries in the financial report, the "filter" function of rainyDay
will let view a filtered list of statements based by the criteria you want to filter by

Format : `filter FLAG FIELD`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to filter by description
    * `-c` to filter by category
    * `-date` to filter by date
    * `-in` to filter by inflows
    * `-out` to filter by outflows
* date `FIELD` must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY

Example of usage: After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you:
![viewForFilter.png](viewForFilter.png)

Suppose you want to find out transactions related to chicken, you can use this command:
- `filter -d chicken`
![filterChicken.png](filterChicken.png)

Suppose you want to check your outflows only, you can use this command:
- `filter -out`
![filterOutflow.png](filterOutflow.png)

> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** Multiple flags may be used at once but must be in this order: 
> 
> `-d` -> `-c` -> `-date` -> `-in` or `out`
> 
> Suppose you want to find out what food you ate on a particular day, you can use this command:
> 
> `filter -c Food and Drinks -date 26/03/2023`
> 
> ![FilterMultipleFlags.png](FilterMultipleFlags.png)


### Edit statements

Transactions keyed in may contain input errors by mistake. rainyDay's "edit" function supports editing a single entry
from your overview

Format : `edit INDEX ADDCOMMAND` or `edit INDEX FLAG NEWFIELD` or `edit INDEX FLAG`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `date` to edit the date
    * `-in` to change direction to inflow
    * `-out` to change direction to outflow
